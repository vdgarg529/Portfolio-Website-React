# Access Modifiers in C++

## 1. Detailed Notes

### What are Access Modifiers?
Access Modifiers in C++ define the **scope** and **visibility** of class members (attributes and methods).  
They control **who can access what** in a class.

### Types of Access Modifiers
1. **Public**  
   - Members are accessible **from anywhere** in the program.  
   - Most commonly used for methods and sometimes attributes.  

2. **Private**  
   - Members are accessible **only within the class**.  
   - Ensures **encapsulation** and **data security**.  

3. **Protected**  
   - Members are accessible **within the class and its derived classes**.  
   - Used in **inheritance scenarios**.

---

## 2. Definition
- **Public**: No restriction on access.  
- **Private**: Strictly accessible inside the class only.  
- **Protected**: Accessible inside the class and derived (child) classes.  

---

## 3. Key Points to Remember
- Default access modifier in a class is **private**.  
- Use **private** for sensitive data, and provide access through **public methods**.  
- Use **protected** when designing classes meant for **inheritance**.  
- Access modifiers enforce **encapsulation** and prevent accidental misuse.

     |        Class            |
     +-------------------------+
     |   public:    Anywhere   |
     |   private:   Class only |
     |   protected: Class +    |
     |              Child      |

## 5. C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
public:     // Accessible everywhere
    int pubVar;

private:    // Accessible only inside this class
    int privVar;

protected:  // Accessible in this class + derived classes
    int protVar;

public:
    // Constructor
    Demo() {
        pubVar = 10;
        privVar = 20;
        protVar = 30;
    }

    // Public method to access private variable
    void showPrivate() {
        cout << "Private Variable = " << privVar << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Derived : public Demo {
public:
    void showProtected() {
        cout << "Protected Variable = " << protVar << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Demo obj;
    cout << "Public Variable = " << obj.pubVar << endl; // Accessible

    obj.showPrivate();  // Access private via public method

    Derived d;
    d.showProtected();  // Access protected via derived class method

    return 0;
}
```


## 6. Real World Example

Think of **Access Modifiers** like a **house**:

- **Public area**: Living room – anyone can enter.
    
- **Private area**: Bedroom – only you (class) can enter.
    
- **Protected area**: Family-only room – you and your children (derived classes) can enter.

## 7. 10 Questions with Answers

### Theory

1. **Q:** What is the default access modifier in a C++ class?  
    **A:** `private`.
    
2. **Q:** Which access modifier allows class members to be accessible everywhere in the program?  
    **A:** `public`.
    
3. **Q:** Which access modifier is used for inheritance purposes, where child classes can access members but outsiders cannot?  
    **A:** `protected`.
    
4. **Q:** Why should sensitive data be declared private?  
    **A:** To enforce **encapsulation** and prevent unauthorized direct access.
    
5. **Q:** What happens if we try to access a private member directly outside the class?  
    **A:** Compiler error – it’s not accessible.

### Coding

6. **Q:** Write a C++ program with a `BankAccount` class where `balance` is private and accessible only via `deposit()` and `getBalance()` methods.
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;

public:
    BankAccount(double bal) {
        balance = bal;
    }

    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount acc(1000);
    acc.deposit(500);
    cout << "Balance = " << acc.getBalance() << endl;  // ✅ works
    // cout << acc.balance;  ❌ ERROR: balance is private
    return 0;
}

```

7. **Q:** Demonstrate how `protected` access works in inheritance with a `Person` (base class) and `Student` (derived class).
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
protected:
    string name; // accessible in derived class

public:
    void setName(string n) {
        name = n;
    }
};

class Student : public Person {
public:
    void showName() {
        cout << "Student Name: " << name << endl; // ✅ allowed
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    s.setName("Alice");
    s.showName();
    return 0;
}

```

8. **Q:** Write a program to show that private members are inaccessible in derived classes.
    
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
private:
    int secret = 42; // not accessible in derived
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void showSecret() {
        // cout << secret; ❌ ERROR: private member not accessible
        cout << "Cannot access private member from derived class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.showSecret();
    return 0;
}

```

---

9. **Q:** Write a C++ program where a public method gives access to modify a private variable (`password`).
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class User {
private:
    string password;

public:
    void setPassword(string pass) {
        password = pass;
    }

    void showPassword() {
        cout << "Password: " << password << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    User u;
    u.setPassword("secure123");
    u.showPassword();
    return 0;
}

```

---

10. **Q:** Create a class `Car` where:
    

- `model` is public
    
- `price` is private
    
- `engineCapacity` is protected and shown by a derived class.
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string model;

private:
    double price;

protected:
    int engineCapacity;

public:
    Car(string m, double p, int e) {
        model = m;
        price = p;
        engineCapacity = e;
    }

    void showPrice() {
        cout << "Price: " << price << endl;
    }
};

class SportsCar : public Car {
public:
    SportsCar(string m, double p, int e) : Car(m, p, e) {}

    void showEngine() {
        cout << "Engine Capacity: " << engineCapacity << " CC" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    SportsCar sc("Ferrari", 200000, 4000);
    cout << "Model: " << sc.model << endl;
    sc.showPrice();     // Access private via method
    sc.showEngine();    // Access protected in derived
    return 0;
}

```
