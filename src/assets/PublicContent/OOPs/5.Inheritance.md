# Inheritance in C++

## 1. Detailed Notes

### Introduction
- **Inheritance** is an OOP mechanism where a new class (**derived/child**) acquires properties and behaviors of an existing class (**base/parent**).  
- Promotes **code reusability**.  
- Derived class can **extend or override** parent functionality.  

---

### Code Reusability
- Base class defines common attributes/methods.  
- Derived classes reuse them without rewriting.  

---

### Constructor and Destructor Call Order
1. **Constructor Call Order**  
   - Parent (base class) constructor is called **first**.  
   - Then child (derived class) constructor executes.  

2. **Destructor Call Order**  
   - Child destructor executes **first**.  
   - Then parent destructor is called.  

👉 This ensures resources are allocated from top to bottom, but released from bottom to top.

---

### Default Constructor of Parent Class
- If no constructor is explicitly called in derived class, the **default constructor of parent class** is invoked automatically.  

---

### Parameterized Constructor in Inheritance
- To call a **parameterized constructor of parent**, derived class must use **initializer list syntax**.

```cpp
Derived(int x, int y) : Base(x) {
    // derived class body
}


```

### Mode of Inheritance

Inheritance can be declared with **access specifiers**:

1. **Public Inheritance**
    
    - public in parent → public in child
        
    - protected in parent → protected in child
        
    - private in parent → inaccessible
        
2. **Protected Inheritance**
    
    - public in parent → protected in child
        
    - protected in parent → protected in child
        
3. **Private Inheritance**
    
    - public in parent → private in child
        
    - protected in parent → private in child
        

---

### Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance** – One parent, one child.
    
2. **Multiple Inheritance** – Child class inherits from multiple parents.
    
3. **Multilevel Inheritance** – Inheritance across multiple levels.
    
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** – One parent, multiple children.
    
5. **Hybrid Inheritance** – Combination of above (may involve ambiguity).
    

---

## 2. Definitions

- **Inheritance:** Mechanism of creating new classes from existing ones.
    
- **Base Class:** The parent class.
    
- **Derived Class:** The child class.
    
- **Mode of Inheritance:** The access control (public/protected/private) used when inheriting.
    

---

## 3. Key Points to Remember

- Base constructor executes **before** derived.
    
- Derived destructor executes **before** base destructor.
    
- If not specified, base **default constructor** is automatically called.
    
- Parameterized base constructor must be explicitly called in derived class.
    
- **Public inheritance** = “is-a” relationship.

       +------------------+
       |     Base Class   |
       +------------------+
          ^         ^
          |         |

## 5. C++ Implementation

### Basic Inheritance

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() { cout << "Eating..." << endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() { cout << "Barking..." << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Dog d;
    d.eat();   // inherited
    d.bark();  // child-specific
    return 0;
}

```

---

### Constructor and Destructor Order

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base constructor\n"; }
    ~Base() { cout << "Base destructor\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived constructor\n"; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    return 0;
}

```

**Output:**

```kotlin
Base constructor
Derived constructor
Derived destructor
Base destructor

```

---

### Parameterized Constructor in Inheritance

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base(int x) { cout << "Base constructor: " << x << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived(int x, int y) : Base(x) {
        cout << "Derived constructor: " << y << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d(10, 20);
    return 0;
}

```

---

### Modes of Inheritance Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Parent {
public:
    int x;
protected:
    int y;
private:
    int z;
};

class Child : public Parent {
    // x -> public
    // y -> protected
    // z -> not accessible
};

```
---

### Types of Inheritance (Quick Examples)

// Single Inheritance

```cpp
class A {};  
class B : public A {};
```

// Multiple Inheritance

```cpp
class A {};  
class B {};  
class C : public A, public B {};

```

// Multilevel Inheritance

```cpp
class A {};  
class B : public A {};  
class C : public B {};
```

// Hierarchical Inheritance

```cpp
class A {};  
class B : public A {};  
class C : public A {};
```


// Hybrid Inheritance

```cpp
class A {};  
class B : public A {};  
class C : public A {};  
class D : public B, public C {};  // Diamond problem

```

## 6. Real World Example

- **Inheritance:** A **Car** class inherits from **Vehicle**.
    
    - Vehicle defines common methods: `start()`, `stop()`.
        
    - Car adds new methods: `airConditioner()`.
        
- **Code Reuse:** Every vehicle doesn’t need to rewrite `start()`.
    
- **Constructor Order:** When building a car, **chassis (base)** is built before the **body (derived)**, but when dismantling, body is removed first.

## 7. Questions with Answers

### Theory

1. **Q:** What is inheritance?  
    **A:** It’s the mechanism of deriving a new class (child) from an existing class (parent), enabling code reuse.
    
2. **Q:** Which constructor is called first in inheritance?  
    **A:** Base class constructor is called first, then derived class constructor.
    
3. **Q:** Which destructor is called first in inheritance?  
    **A:** Derived class destructor is called first, then base class destructor.
    
4. **Q:** What happens if base class has no default constructor but only a parameterized one?  
    **A:** Derived class must explicitly call the base parameterized constructor.
    
5. **Q:** Difference between public, protected, and private inheritance?  
    **A:**
    
    - Public → base public → child public
        
    - Protected → base public → child protected
        
    - Private → base public/protected → child private

### Coding

6. **Q:** Write a program to show order of constructor/destructor calls in single inheritance.
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() { cout << "Base constructor\n"; }
    ~Base() { cout << "Base destructor\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { cout << "Derived constructor\n"; }
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    return 0;
}

```

---

7. **Q:** Demonstrate parameterized constructor calling from derived to base.
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Parent {
public:
    Parent(int x) { cout << "Parent constructor: " << x << endl; }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    Child(int x, int y) : Parent(x) {
        cout << "Child constructor: " << y << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Child c(5, 10);
    return 0;
}

```

---

8. **Q:** Show an example of multilevel inheritance.
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    void displayA() { cout << "Class A" << endl; }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    void displayB() { cout << "Class B" << endl; }
};

class C : public B {
public:
    void displayC() { cout << "Class C" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    C obj;
    obj.displayA();
    obj.displayB();
    obj.displayC();
    return 0;
}

```

---

9. **Q:** Show a program with hierarchical inheritance.
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Vehicle {
public:
    void drive() { cout << "Driving vehicle" << endl; }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void airConditioner() { cout << "Car AC on" << endl; }
};

class Bike : public Vehicle {
public:
    void helmet() { cout << "Bike helmet on" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Car c; Bike b;
    c.drive(); c.airConditioner();
    b.drive(); b.helmet();
    return 0;
}

```

---

10. **Q:** Demonstrate multiple inheritance.
    

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Teacher {
public:
    void teach() { cout << "Teaching..." << endl; }
};

class Researcher {
public:
    void research() { cout << "Researching..." << endl; }
};

class Professor : public Teacher, public Researcher {
public:
    void guide() { cout << "Guiding students..." << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Professor p;
    p.teach();
    p.research();
    p.guide();
    return 0;
}

```
