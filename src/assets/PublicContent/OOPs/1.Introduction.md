# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics

## 1. Detailed Notes

### What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a **programming paradigm** that organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions or logic.  
Objects represent **real-world entities** and contain both **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**.

### Four Pillars of OOP
1. **Encapsulation** – Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).  
2. **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.  
3. **Inheritance** – Mechanism to create a new class (child) from an existing class (parent), reusing code.  
4. **Polymorphism** – Ability of different classes to respond to the same function call in different ways.

### Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint/template that defines attributes and methods.  
- **Object**: A real-world instance of a class. Multiple objects can be created from one class.  

### Attributes and Methods
- **Attributes (Data Members)**: Variables inside a class that define the state of the object.  
- **Methods (Member Functions)**: Functions inside a class that define the behavior of the object.

## 2. Definition

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A programming model that structures programs around **objects** which have **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions).  
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.  
- **Object**: An instance of a class that represents a specific entity.  
- **Attribute**: A variable inside a class that stores data about the object.  
- **Method**: A function inside a class that defines actions/behavior of the object.  
- **Encapsulation**: The mechanism of **bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions)** that operate on that data into a single unit, called a **class**. It also involves **restricting direct access to some of an object's components**, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse.
- **Abstraction**: The concept of **hiding the complex implementation details** and showing only the essential features of an object. It reduces complexity by allowing you to interact with an object at a higher level without worrying about how it works internally.
- **Inheritance**: The process by which one class (called the **derived class** or **child class**) **acquires the properties and behaviors (methods)** of another class (called the **base class** or **parent class**). It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.
- **Polymorphism**: The process by which one class (called the **derived class** or **child class**) **acquires the properties and behaviors (methods)** of another class (called the **base class** or **parent class**). It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

## 3. Key Points to Remember

- OOP helps in **modularity**, **code reuse**, and **maintainability**.  
- A **class** is not memory-consuming until an **object** is created.  
- **Encapsulation** ensures data security.  
- **Polymorphism** increases flexibility in code.  
- **Inheritance** avoids code duplication.  
- **Abstraction** reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details.

## 5. C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Class definition (Blueprint)
class Car {
public:
    // Attributes (data members)
    string brand;
    string model;
    int year;

    // Method (member function)
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Car: " << brand << " " << model 
             << " (" << year << ")" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating objects (instances of Car class)
    Car car1;  
    car1.brand = "Toyota";
    car1.model = "Corolla";
    car1.year = 2020;

    Car car2;  
    car2.brand = "Tesla";
    car2.model = "Model S";
    car2.year = 2022;

    // Using methods
    car1.displayInfo();
    car2.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}
```


## 6. Real World Example

- Think of a **class** as a **blueprint for a house**.
    
- Each **house built using that blueprint** is an **object**.
    
- **Attributes**: The house’s color, size, number of rooms.
    
- **Methods**: Actions like openDoor(), lockDoor(), turnOnLights().
    

This helps us represent **real-world entities** (cars, bank accounts, employees, etc.) in code.

## 7. 10 Questions and Answers

### Theory

1. **Define Object-Oriented Programming and list its four pillars.**
    
    - OOP is a paradigm where code is organized around **objects** (data + behavior).
        
    - Four pillars: **Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism**.
        
2. **What is the difference between a class and an object?**
    
    - Class: A **blueprint** for creating objects.
        
    - Object: A **real instance** of a class with actual values.
        
3. **Explain encapsulation with an example.**
    
    - Encapsulation means bundling data and methods in one unit and restricting direct access.
        
    - Example: In a `BankAccount` class, `balance` can be private, and only methods like `deposit()`/`withdraw()` can change it.
        
4. **Why is abstraction important in OOP?**
    
    - Abstraction hides unnecessary implementation details and shows only **relevant features** to the user.
        
    - Example: When using a car, you just press the accelerator (method) without knowing how the engine works (implementation).
        
5. **How does polymorphism help in reducing code complexity?**
    
    - Polymorphism allows the same function name to have different behaviors in different contexts.
        
    - This avoids writing multiple different function names and improves readability.

### Coding

6. Write a C++ program to create a `Student` class with attributes `name`, `rollNo`, and `marks`, and a method to display details.
    
7. Create a class `BankAccount` with attributes `accountNumber`, `balance`, and methods `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. Demonstrate its use.
    
8. Implement a program that creates multiple objects of a `Book` class and prints their details.
    
9. Write a C++ program that demonstrates the concept of encapsulation using private data members and public methods.
    
10. Create a class `Employee` with attributes `id`, `salary`, and a method to calculate yearly salary. Instantiate two employees and display their salaries.
