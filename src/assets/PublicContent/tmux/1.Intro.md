## What is **tmux** in Linux?

**tmux (Terminal MUltipleXer)** lets you run **multiple terminals inside one terminal**, and—most importantly—**keep your programs running even if your SSH connection drops**. tmux runs your process **on the server**, not tied to your SSH session.

For **remote ML training**, tmux is almost mandatory.
