# Security in System Design (1.2)

Designing secure systems requires embedding security principles directly into the architecture and development lifecycle rather than treating them as afterthoughts. Security in system design ensures that confidentiality, integrity, and availability are preserved across every layer of the system.

---

## 1.2.1 Secure by Design
- **Definition**: Building security measures into the foundation of systems rather than adding them later.
- **Core Aspects**:
  - Use of **secure coding practices**.
  - Design with **threat models** in mind.
  - Principle of **fail-secure defaults** (system fails in a safe state).
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces vulnerabilities early in development.
  - Improves system trustworthiness.

---

## 1.2.2 Threat Modeling
- **Definition**: A process for identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities in the design phase.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify assets (data, users, services).
  2. Identify potential attackers and their capabilities.
  3. Define possible attack vectors (SQL injection, phishing, privilege escalation).
  4. Prioritize risks using models like **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege).
  5. Define mitigations.
- **Outcome**: Helps developers and architects build systems that anticipate and resist attacks.

## 1.2.3 Security Architecture and Design Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls.
- **Least Privilege**: Minimize access rights to the bare minimum required.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: If a failure occurs, the system defaults to a secure state.
- **Economy of Mechanism**: Keep the design simple and small.
- **Open Design**: Security should not depend on obscurity.
- **Separation of Duties**: Split critical tasks among multiple roles to reduce insider threat.
- **Minimization of Attack Surface**: Reduce the number of entry points into the system.

---

## 1.2.4 Security Patterns
- **Definition**: Reusable solutions to recurring security design problems.
- **Examples**:
  - **Authentication Pattern**: How users prove identity.
  - **Authorization Pattern**: How systems grant/deny access.
  - **Secure Logger Pattern**: Ensures logs are tamper-proof.
  - **Sandbox Pattern**: Restricts execution of untrusted code.

---

## 1.2.5 Architectural Considerations for Security
- **System Components**:
  - Networks (firewalls, segmentation, VPNs).
  - Applications (input validation, secure APIs).
  - Databases (encryption at rest, access controls).
- **Cloud-Specific Considerations**:
  - Shared responsibility model (cloud provider vs customer).
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM).
  - Multi-tenancy isolation.

---

## 1.2.6 Security Design Trade-offs
- **Performance vs Security**: Example â€“ Encryption can slow down systems, but protects data.
- **Cost vs Security**: High-level security solutions can be expensive.
- **Usability vs Security**: Strict authentication policies may frustrate users.

---

## 1.2.7 Secure System Design in Practice
- **Case Study Example**:
  - Designing an e-commerce platform:
    - Secure payment gateway with encryption.
    - Role-based access control for administrators.
    - Logging and monitoring of transactions.
    - Regular security testing (penetration tests).

---

## 1.2.8 Tools and Frameworks for Secure Design
- **Tools**:
  - Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool.
  - OWASP Threat Dragon.
  - STRIDE, DREAD models.
- **Frameworks**:
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
  - SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture).
  - ISO/IEC 27001.

---

## 1.2.9 Best Practices
- Conduct security reviews at every stage of design.
- Regularly update threat models as systems evolve.
- Apply security patches promptly.
- Automate security testing in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 1.2.10 Summary
Security in system design is about proactive defense. By integrating secure-by-design principles, applying threat modeling, using security patterns, and balancing trade-offs, organizations can build resilient systems capable of resisting modern cyber threats.
