# Introduction to DBMS

## 1. What is Data?

- **Definition**:  
    Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, numbers, figures, observations, or symbols.
    
    - It has **no specific purpose** or meaning on its own.
        
    - Measured in bits and bytes in the context of computer storage and processing.
        
    - Data can be recorded and stored but is meaningless until processed.

## 2. Types of Data

1. **Quantitative Data**
    
    - Numerical in nature.
        
    - Examples: weight, volume, cost of an item.
        
2. **Qualitative Data**
    
    - Descriptive but not numerical.
        
    - Examples: name, gender, hair color of a person.

## 3. What is Information?

- **Definition**: Processed, organized, and structured data.
    
- **Characteristics**:
    
    - Provides **context** for data.
        
    - Enables **decision-making**.
        
    - Extracted by **analyzing and interpreting** data.
        
- **Examples**:
    
    - “There are 100 senior citizens.”
        
    - “The sex ratio is 1:1.”
        
    - “100 newborn babies.”  
        → These are information derived from raw data.

## 4. Data vs Information

- **Data**: Raw facts, unorganized, often meaningless alone.
    
- **Information**: Data put into context, analyzed, and meaningful.
    
- Data points are **individual**; information shows the **big picture**.
    
- **Dependency**:
    
    - Data does not depend on information.
        
    - Information depends on data.
        
- **Decision-making**:
    
    - Data alone is insufficient.
        
    - Information supports decision-making.

## 5. What is a Database?

- **Definition**:  
    A database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a structured way so it can be **easily accessed, managed, and updated**.
    
- **Purpose**: To make raw data useful, we need **DBMS**.

## 6. What is DBMS?

- **Definition**:  
    A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that manages databases by providing:
    
    1. A collection of **interrelated data**.
        
    2. A **set of programs** to access those data.
        
- **Functions**:
    
    - Store and retrieve data efficiently.
        
    - Provide operations: **addition, access, updating, deletion**.
        
- **Goal**: Convenience + efficiency.

## 7. DBMS vs File Systems

- **Disadvantages of File Systems**:
    
    1. Data redundancy & inconsistency.
        
    2. Difficulty in accessing data.
        
    3. Data isolation.
        
    4. Integrity problems.
        
    5. Atomicity problems.
        
    6. Concurrent access anomalies.
        
    7. Security problems.
        
- **Advantages of DBMS**:
    
    - The **above problems are solved** in DBMS.
        
    - Hence, DBMS ensures **data integrity, security, reduced redundancy, better access control**.
