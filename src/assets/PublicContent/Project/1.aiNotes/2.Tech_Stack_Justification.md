### **1. Framework: FastAPI**

- **Why FastAPI over others?** I chose FastAPI for its unparalleled developer experience and performance in building modern, asynchronous APIs. Its native support for ASGI, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and seamless integration with Pydantic for data validation allowed me to develop robust, self-documenting endpoints rapidly. The async capabilities are crucial for handling multiple concurrent requests to I/O-bound services like the Gemini API without blocking.
    
- **Other Popular Options:**
    
    - **Flask:** Simpler, more minimalistic, and has a massive ecosystem. However, it's synchronous by default (without extensions), and you have to manually build things like OpenAPI docs and data validation.
        
    - **Django/Django REST Framework (DRF):** A "batteries-included" monolithic framework. Excellent for large, structured applications with built-in admin panels, ORM, and authentication. However, it's heavier, more opinionated, and its synchronous nature can be a bottleneck for high-performance, async-heavy AI pipelines.
        
- **Advantages & Disadvantages:**
    
    |Option|Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |---|---|---|
    |**FastAPI (Your Choice)**|**High performance** (async), **automatic docs**, **easy data validation** (Pydantic), excellent **type hints** support.|Younger ecosystem than Django/Flask, less "batteries-included" than Django.|
    |**Flask**|**Extremely simple and flexible**, **massive community** and extensions.|**Synchronous core**, no built-in data validation or async support (requires extensions).|
    |**Django/DRF**|**All-in-one solution**, incredibly **structured**, best for CRUD-heavy apps, **built-in admin UI**.|**Heavier and more opinionated**, can be **overkill** for microservices, **synchronous**.|
    
- **How to Justify:** "For this AI-powered API, performance and developer efficiency were my top priorities. FastAPI's async-first design ensures the server remains responsive while waiting for LLM and embedding responses. Furthermore, the automatic Swagger UI documentation drastically reduces the time needed to test endpoints and onboard other developers, while Pydantic integration guarantees data integrity at the API boundaries."

### **2. Vector Database: ChromaDB**

- **Why ChromaDB over others?** I chose ChromaDB in persistent mode because it provided the simplest possible path to a fully functional, self-hosted vector store. Its Python-first API integrated seamlessly with the rest of the stack, and it allowed me to get started immediately without dealing with the complexity of managing a separate database server. For a project at this stage, the priority was velocity and simplicity.
    
- **Other Popular Options:**
    
    - **Pinecone:** A fully-managed, cloud-native vector database. It handles scaling, persistence, and performance optimization for you.
        
    - **Weaviate:** An open-source vector database that can be self-hosted or managed. It's more powerful and feature-rich than Chroma, with a built-in graph-like data model and more query flexibility.
        
    - **Qdrant:** Another high-performance open-source vector database, often compared to Weaviate, known for its speed and Rust-based engine.
        
- **Advantages & Disadvantages:**
    
    |Option|Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |---|---|---|
    |**ChromaDB (Your Choice)**|**Dead-simple to start**, **zero configuration**, **perfect for prototypes and small apps**, **runs in-process**.|**Not designed for large-scale production** workloads, lacks advanced features like built-in auth, scaling can be a challenge.|
    |**Pinecone**|**Fully managed**, **effortless scaling**, **high performance**, **highly available**.|**Cost**, **vendor lock-in**, data leaves your infrastructure.|
    |**Weaviate/Qdrant**|**Open-source**, **powerful query language**, **production-ready**, can be self-hosted for control.|**Operational overhead** of managing another database service, **steeper learning curve** than Chroma.|
    
- **How to Justify:** "My choice of ChromaDB was a pragmatic one based on the project's current needs. It provided a lightweight, yet powerful, vector store that was trivial to integrate and kept the entire system running locally during development. This was ideal for rapid iteration. I'm aware of its scaling limitations, and the architecture is designed so that we can easily swap it out for a more robust solution like Weaviate or Pinecone when the need for scale and high availability arises."

### **3. Embeddings: Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)**

- **Why a Local Model over an API?** Using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model locally was a conscious decision to prioritize **data privacy, cost-efficiency, and latency**. User notes often contain sensitive information; processing them locally ensures they never leave our infrastructure. It also eliminates per-call costs and network latency, making the application more responsive and reliable.
    
- **Other Popular Options:**
    
    - **OpenAI Embeddings API (text-embedding-3-small/large):** A simple API call to get high-quality embeddings.
        
    - **Cohere Embed API:** Another popular provider for embedding APIs.
        
    - **Hugging Face Inference API:** Allows you to run thousands of models via API without hosting them yourself.
        
- **Advantages & Disadvantages:**
    
    |Option|Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |---|---|---|
    |**Local Model (Your Choice)**|**Data never leaves the server**, **zero ongoing cost**, **predictable latency**, **offline capability**.|**Initial load time & memory usage**, **model is static** (unless updated manually), potentially **lower accuracy** than SOTA APIs.|
    |**Embedding API (e.g., OpenAI)**|**State-of-the-art accuracy**, **no memory footprint** on your server, **always up-to-date**, **effortless to use**.|**Per-request cost**, **data privacy concerns** (data sent to 3rd party), **network latency and downtime risk**.|
    
- **How to Justify:** "This decision was driven by a core requirement: keeping user data completely private. By running the embedding model on our own hardware, we guarantee that sensitive user notes are never transmitted to a third party. Furthermore, it makes the system more cost-effective and resilient, as it doesn't depend on an external API's availability or pricing changes. We traded a small amount of accuracy for significant gains in privacy and operational control."

### **4. LLM: Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API**

- **Why Gemini API over others?** For the summarization task, I needed a powerful, cost-effective, and fast model. Gemini 1.5 Flash is specifically designed for this – it's Google's most efficient model for high-volume, general-purpose tasks. It offers an excellent balance of speed, cost, and reasoning ability compared to other options, making it perfect for generating summaries from retrieved context.
    
- **Other Popular Options:**
    
    - **OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4o:** Often considered the state-of-the-art in reasoning and instruction following.
        
    - **Anthropic Claude 3:** Known for its long context window and strong safety/constitutional AI features.
        
    - **Self-hosted LLM (e.g., Llama 3):** Running an open-weight model on your own infrastructure.
        
- **Advantages & Disadvantages:**
    
    |Option|Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |---|---|---|
    |**Gemini 1.5 Flash (Your Choice)**|**Very low cost**, **extremely fast**, **high throughput**, **good enough** reasoning for summarization.|**Less capable** at complex reasoning than larger models, **vendor dependency**.|
    |**GPT-4o**|**Top-tier reasoning & multilingual capabilities**, **very smart**, **easy API**.|**Higher cost**, can be **slower** than Flash.|
    |**Self-hosted LLM**|**Complete data privacy and control**, **no per-call costs**.|**Massive infrastructure cost** (GPUs), **significant operational complexity**, **lower output quality** unless using very large models.|
    
- **How to Justify:** "For the generation step, Gemini 1.5 Flash was the most pragmatic choice. The summarization task doesn't require the absolute peak reasoning capability of a GPT-4o, but it does benefit from low latency and high throughput, which Flash excels at. It allows us to provide a high-quality AI feature to users at a very low operational cost, which is crucial for sustainability."

### **5. Relational Database: SQLite**

- **Why SQLite over a client-server DB?** SQLite is the perfect choice for the initial phase of user management. Its operational simplicity is unmatched—there's no separate database process to manage, configure, or secure. It's more than capable of handling the load of a growing user base initially and keeps the system architecture incredibly simple.
    
- **Other Popular Options:**
    
    - **PostgreSQL:** The advanced open-source SQL database. The gold standard for most web applications.
        
    - **MySQL:** Another very popular open-source SQL database.
        
- **Advantages & Disadvantages:**
    
    |Option|Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |---|---|---|
    |**SQLite (Your Choice)**|**Zero configuration**, **serverless**, **simple disk-based files**, **perfect for low-to-medium traffic**.|**Not designed for high-write concurrent workloads**, **no network access** (can't scale out).|
    |**PostgreSQL**|**Highly scalable**, **feature-rich** (JSONB, Geospatial, etc.), **rock-solid reliability**, **strong concurrency**.|**Requires a dedicated server/process**, **higher operational overhead**.|
    
- **How to Justify:** "I started with SQLite for user management because it's a robust, ACID-compliant database that eliminates any operational overhead during the early stages. The user table is inherently low-throughput, and SQLite is more than capable of handling this load. Using SQLAlchemy as the ORM means we are not locked in; the migration path to PostgreSQL for when we need higher concurrency is straightforward and well-trodden."

### **6. Auth: JWT + bcrypt**

- **Why JWT + bcrypt?** This is a modern, stateless, and scalable authentication standard. JWTs are secure, self-contained, and perfect for API-centric architectures as they allow for easy horizontal scaling of your backend services. bcrypt is the industry-standard algorithm for password hashing, as it's intentionally slow and salted, making it highly resistant to brute-force attacks.
    
- **Other Popular Options:**
    
    - **Session-Based Auth (with Redis):** Storing session data in a fast key-store like Redis.
        
    - **OAuth2/OpenID Connect (e.g., "Login with Google"):** Delegating authentication to a third-party provider.
        
    - **SSO/SAML:** For enterprise authentication.
        
- **Advantages & Disadvantages:**
    
    |Option|Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |---|---|---|
    |**JWT + bcrypt (Your Choice)**|**Stateless** (no server-side sessions), **scalable**, **standardized**, **secure**.|**More complex to implement** than sessions, **logout/revocation requires extra work**.|
    |**Session-Based Auth**|**Simpler to understand**, **easy instant logout**.|**Stateful** (requires a shared session store), **can become a bottleneck**.|
    
- **How to Justify:** "I implemented stateless JWT authentication because it aligns perfectly with the RESTful, API-first design of the service. It allows for clean scalability without the need for a shared session store. I paired it with bcrypt, which is the consensus choice for password hashing due to its adaptive work factor and proven resistance against cracking attempts."
